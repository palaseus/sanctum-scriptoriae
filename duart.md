The hills rose hard where e'er stood,
Their feet set firm in stone and rain;
The land took oath in flesh and blood
And learned the weight of clan Maclean

From Gillean’s hand the axe was sworn,
To cut a path through mist and fear;
Not forged for praise, nor raised in scorn,
But held when all that’s loved is near.

Hector strode where tides ran red,
His name a line the storm would test;
He fought for more than quickened dead,
He fought so loss might still have rest.

The loch keeps truths the tongue lets go,
The wind repeats what bones retain:
What’s taken still moves deep below
Duart, the heart of the clan Maclean.
