In the shadow of some distant coup,  
A leader whispers, "What shall we do?"  
Allies shift like sand,  
Deals struck underhand,  
While maps redraw in a midnight hue.

From Asia's edge to Africa's shore,  
One policy tweak opens the door.  
Fear ripples the sea,  
Uncertainty's key,  
Turning friends into foes evermore.

A handshake in Europe, sly and concealed,  
Unravels the threads of a pact once sealed.  
Strategies bend,  
Consequences descend,  
Like jazz notes that twist and unreel.

The weight of one vote in a faraway hall  
Sets chains in motion, making empires stall.  
Hidden talks ignite,  
Alliances take flight,  
And the world holds its breath for the fall.

Now the last piece teeters, poised on the brink,  
A breath away from the ultimate clink.  
Will it topple or stand?  
In this geopolitical band,  
The rhythm plays on, what do you think?
