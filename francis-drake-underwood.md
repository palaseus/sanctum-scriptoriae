The glint of steel reflects and blinds the eye,
bootswain draws blade, severs the anchor's tie.
Wide and tall, the cloth drops across the mast,
triskelion sails spring forth and shadows cast.

From crow's nest, a ragged Jolly Roger's spied,
and at the helm, rudders turn against the tide.
Below deck all gunners sing, as they hold fast,
they fear not the locker, nor the cannon blast.

The Atlantic horizon holds not a place to hide,
across piratical bow, hot spherical iron flies.
Black patchwork whip skyward as it speeds past,
torch and brazier ignite as a darkness amassed.

You shall be boarded or sunk! Our master cried,
it is without their honor that the pirate dies.
Flintlock fire returned, our munitions outlast,
enemy plank further splintered pass after pass.

A white flag now raises where black once rides,
the captain surrenders and his mates all abide.
Bloodied deck leaks with the battle's contrast,
ship's hold never filled with treasure so vast.
