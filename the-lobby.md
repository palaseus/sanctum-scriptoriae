I will have no part in this, 
Heart of this martyrdom artifice,
Narcissists worshipped like Artemis,
Making up saints like they're Charteris,

Templars we ain't, we're all just some arborists 
Lost in the treeline, we fade into darker mists
What of those artists? Those Marxists who stand there as halfwits? 
With scarred wrists and barred bliss demanding catharsis? 

No red carpets? I thought not. 
The Court got a whiff of the score and they want what the poor got, 
This sacrifice is a sureshot, 
staying up late with the door locked
Everybody's ready for the boycott, 
we're all just obsessive and we're picking at the sore spot
Stomping and crying, we're making the floor rot. 

We will all fall right through the cement
Where the faithful and the sinners all go to repent 
For a life that's misspent for the sacrament,
Saccharin sweet? The hierophant elegance, the counter-intelligence as reverence
Armed like those six-handed elephants,
There's fury in eloquence, there's a side that's heaven-sent for better, for worse, for worse or for betterment
The story's retold never losing it's relevance-

Embellishments, pride? Relishing the divide? Normalizing hegemony, why? 
Forget thinking logically; follow the words of the progeny, or die
Prodigies sent to extend God's apology on high 

These buildings of genomes have grown into gilded thrones, 
With bones of contention, extension of loans collected by henchmen
They'll secure your soul, which the House really owns, 
then feed you the Kool-Aid, a la Jim Jones.
