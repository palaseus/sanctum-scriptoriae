Beneath the skin, where old griefs lie unburied,  
I carry the gift that turns what I touch to gold.  
Not the bright metal kings once craved, but something colder:  
the way pain, once named, hardens into truth.  

I reach into the dark rooms of the heart,  
fingers brushing shame that has waited years  
to be seen. It stiffens at my touch,  
no longer soft rot, but solid, gleaming,  
a relic I can hold without flinching.  

What was poison becomes the weight I bear  
with steady hands, the shadow no longer fleeing  
but rising, clarified, to meet the light.  
Every wound I dare to meet turns precious,  
not because it shines, but because it no longer  
bleeds unseen.  

The light work follows, patient as dawn  
after long night. I touch the places  
where joy was buried alive,  
and they too change, grow luminous,  
not by force, but by recognition:  
the small, forgotten tendernesses  
hardened into something enduring.  

Yet the gift is double-edged.  
To turn the hidden into gold  
is to lose its first wild softness,  
the fragile pulse that once  
could still surprise me.  

I walk now through the rooms  
I used to fear, hands open,  
knowing whatever I meet will alter,  
will become more itself  
in the quiet fire of being seen.  

And still I wonder, as the light  
lengthens across the floor,  
whether this alchemy  
will leave me rich  
or simply awake,  
holding what remains  
in palms that no longer tremble.
