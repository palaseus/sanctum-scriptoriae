They made their rest where quiet grass held fast,
No tremor stirred their feathers in the sun.
The time had come, only to pass,
And nothing more could alter what was done.
A single voice remained, a thread left to run.
The warder had heard what came before,
A lone sonata shaped by every score.

Each vanished song had carved a space to fill,
Some deep with fire, some measured with command.
Each left a trace in its final will,
A shaping only it could understand.
No note was lost, no meaning left unmanned.
The song arose, resolved, complete, and clear,
A single chord struck as all others veered.

It need not cry foul, nor falter, nor complain,
While holding the weight of all that had been sung.
The passing of their time left no stain,
Through this tone the world’s true form was wrung.
No loss remained; no mortal grief was hung.
The final sound endured, unclaimed, alone,
A crown of silence made from each alone.
