Summer lurks over the southern horizon
I wish you would rise a little higher
So I could see Antares burn
With your heart of fire.

An agent of the huntress Artemis
On her mission to dispatch Orion
Hearing of his unrepentant pride
As if he could slay the Lion.

As reward, Zeus placed you in our sky
Forever immortalizing your sting
The hunter meanwhile remains on the fly
Fading into the sunrise each spring.

Forever, this celestial pursuit
Through the heavens, endless dispute.
