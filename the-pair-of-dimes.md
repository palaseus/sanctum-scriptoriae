Two coins that clink in pockets deep,  
Worn smooth by hands that grasp and keep,  
Once stamped with dates of empires past,  
Now blurred, their edges fading fast.  

A dime for dreams that empires built,  
Another for the weight of guilt—  
The old world's axis starts to tilt,  
As paradigms begin to shift.  

Today, in screens that pulse with light,  
We trade the tangible for sight,  
Of codes that weave through air unseen,  
Rewriting what our lives have been.  

No more the metal's heavy claim,  
On value fixed in fortune's game;  
Instead, the ether's fleeting flame,  
Ignites a shift without a name.  

These dimes, a pair in quiet fall,  
Through slots that echo one and all—  
From solid ground to digital call,  
Where boundaries blur and empires stall.  

Yet in their spin, a truth resides:  
The change we chase, or that which hides,  
Transforms the self in silent tides,  
And leaves us on the other side.
