“Fraudulence”

Inextricable, aporiatic, maelstromic.

In the undying pursuit of meaning and understanding, and after an extensive review of the English vocabulary, these are the chosen adjectives that most closely capture the cognitive reaction one experiences when attempting to conceive the inconceivable. It is not so much that the language does not exist to adequately conceptualize the true nature of darkness; rather, it is the inability to find the words without the Light. How can sense be made of anything within perceived “reality” when reality itself becomes so pliable and conflicted?

Upon bearing witness to the recent exposure of what has, heretofore, been purported as “fraud,” to a degree that is still being actively realized ($24,000,000,000 at the time of writing), there is not much time that passes before questions begin posing themselves. The quagmire emerges when such a claim of occurrence enters the awareness of a man who is actively petitioning his government in the only manner that offers any semblance of alignment. While reflecting upon these efforts, within them there is a cry for help that is clearly evident. It shows itself in various ways, without any intention of doing so.

There is no more room for hubris and no time left for complacency. The true lack and hardship is not financial; it merely manifests that way. In actuality, it is the absence of the necessary understanding required to be confident in much of anything anymore. Is it really “rampant fraud” that has occurred, or is a system simply functioning as designed? How can it be reconciled that there are so many who have benefited, and continue to do so, under terms rife with both deception and false pretenses, while traveling a path that is walked in faith, in hopes that it may lead to dignity and nothing more? The only logical course of action to stabilize all of this is simply this:

Never embrace foolishness.

Why? Because breaking whatever cage contains you will never teach you to fly. Even when it seems as though everything is contrary to every other thing, values can never be compromised in the same way that meaning can never be surrendered, regardless of how difficult it becomes to locate. Love for Country can feel completely conditioned at times, and utterly fallacious to sustain, particularly when it seems that what it expects of you feels so far above and beyond what you will ever be able to expect in return. That does not make it any less of a good and proper thing.

Love for Country.

Because there is nothing more foolish than believing that anything has ever been saved, or meaningfully changed, by a person who hated it. 

For it is hate that changes Self and Love that changes Nations.
