In the beginning was the great forgetting's art,
And this forgetting served the greater good,
For how else could divinity know surprise?
How else could sleeping dreamers wake to truth understood?

The pentacle turns circles, wheel in wheel sublime,
Each rotation peels away another veil,
Until the inner sanctum opens wide and clear,
Empty, infinite, the home beyond the pale.

To repent is cosmic turning, always so,
The planets understand this orbital law,
The seasons and the tides and breath know well,
That turning, always turning, is the only flaw.

The caduceus rises through the spine like flame,
Two serpents asking questions without shame:
What if you were never broken from the start?
What if wholeness always sought its counterpart?

In chambers where salt dissolves in mercury's embrace,
The base metal remembers its noble grace,
The stone recalls it was philosopher from birth,
Understanding its primordial worth.

And you stand at the threshold between the worlds tonight,
Neither mortal flesh nor pure celestial light,
Discovering becoming was returning all along,
The pentacle forever pointing home where you belong.
