I was dead, now, I'm not
I believe in miracles
Laughter is close to insanity
Life's sort of hysterical

Death is just an idea
One I can't subscribe to
The reaper has an inner child
Just like you and I do

He's the only one I lie to
When we conversate
Say things he sees right through
When we conglomerate

Luckily
Unlike time, he can be forgiving
In the mornings we share coffee, 
Write rhymes, I guess reliving

I try to work with him
He reminds me he's the boss
That he appreciates my words-
That he's sorry for my loss

Tells me I'm a man of God
And he's only one of science
Together, both creators
An unholy alliance

He says it will be clean
When it's time to pay my toll
And when the bell rings
He'll be grateful for my soul
