A filament of light that learns to thread  
through iron, not to break it, but to pass,  
to find the seam where silence is bred  
and slip inside, deliberate as grass  

that splits the stone it never meant to harm.  
This is no shout, no banner torn and raised,  
but something colder, patient, almost calm:  
the slow insistence of a river’s gaze  

that turns the mountain’s fault into a door.  
Each word withheld for decades carries frost,  
then melts upon the page, and nothing more  
than quiet enters, yet the silence lost  

begins to bleed. The censor lifts his hand,  
believing power still resides in chains,  
while underneath, the current understands  
how pressure builds, how memory remains.  

No trumpet sounds. No sudden banner falls.  
Only the line that moves where no one calls.
