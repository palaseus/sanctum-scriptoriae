In the ledger rooms, entries accumulate  
without ceremony. A signature seals  
the threshold, and streets contract.  

Hands pause over half-eaten bread,  
cups left cooling on sills. Routines  
bend under the weight of notices posted  

at dawn. Elders trace the grain of old doors,  
their fingers mapping prior closures,  
carrying the unmarked hours in bent spines.  

Youth step over those same lines,  
refusing the load, their strides carving  
gaps where inheritance should settle.  

Procedures unfold in stacks of forms,  
delays measured in the slow turn of seals.  
Erasures happen quietly, names lifted  

from lists like dust from a shelf. Futures  
postpone themselves, folded into drawers  
that no key fits anymore.  

Pathways once open now end at blank walls,  
channels sealed without trace, distances  
collapsed into unnavigable voids.  

Absences gather: a child's shoe left  
in the square, voices cut mid-phrase,  
objects abandoned mid-use.  

The machinery hums through partitions,  
impersonal as the shift of gears  
in a clockwork vault.  

Distant observers note the margins,  
their gazes skimming the edges,  
adding nothing to the core.  

One generation shoulders the quiet bulk,  
another discards it, scattering fragments  
that embed in the soil.  

Interruptions compound, routines fracture  
into shards. The administrative net tightens,  
thresholds multiply like unchecked cells.  

Something shifts beneath the procedures,  
a movement etched into the structure,  
unfolding without end or announcement.
