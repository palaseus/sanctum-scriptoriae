In the ledger rooms, entries accumulate
without ceremony. A signature seals
the threshold, and streets contract.

Hands pause over half-eaten bread,
cups left cooling on sills. Routines
bend under the weight of notices posted
at dawn.

Elders trace the grain of old doors,
fingers mapping prior closures,
their bent spines cradling years no calendar claims.

Youth step over those same lines,
refusing the load, strides carving
gaps where the next hand should rest.

Procedures unfold in stacks of forms,
delays measured in the slow turn of seals.
Erasures happen quietly, names lifted
from lists like dust from a shelf.

Futures fold themselves into drawers
whose locks have rusted shut.

Blank walls where doorways used to be.

Absences gather: a child’s shoe left
in the square, voices cut mid-phrase,
a spoon still warm on the table’s edge.

The machinery hums through partitions,
impersonal as the click of gears
behind steel.

One generation carries the ledgers forward,
the next drops them in the street—
pages scattering, ink sinking into soil.

Interruptions compound. Routines fracture.
New thresholds rise unbidden, sealing
themselves behind each signature.

Beneath the procedures something shifts-
a faint tremor in the mortar,
a slow crack travelling without sound
or announcement.
