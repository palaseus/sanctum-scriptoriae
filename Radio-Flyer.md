When a wild animal suddenly experiences its environment reduced to the confines of a cage, it will immediately, and often frantically, begin pacing and searching for any viable exit it can find. Once discovered, it will take it. Even if escape requires the sacrifice of its very own flesh, the spirit will accept the terms. This is an observable fact, and it is in no way different from the human spirit.

The year is 2019, and the world is about to experience a level of chaos previously unimaginable. The energy in the air is explosive and static. Devin awoke at 11 P.M. from another profound slumber. It had become an expected thing, his sleep patterns reflective of his depressive state and shaped by the chaos he was experiencing in his own life. In body, he was as free as a man who had just lost everything can be. It was here that he found the walls.

The laptop screen on the coffee table in front of the couch dimly lit the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. This had become his bed after, at some point, his bedroom began to feel lonely, or perhaps even haunted. The memories it held no longer spoke to his soul the way they once had. There was safety in the family removed, despite the lack of room or safety within his family.

The radio that had lulled him earlier, an older model still equipped with telescoping antennas, was still playing. He glanced at his computer, where a PDF of some grimoire or key he had been studying remained open exactly where he had left it. For whatever reason, the walls he had been pacing, in desperate hope of finding weakness, seemed to have things written on them. A language that looked familiar covered their surfaces, yet it was as though a mirror would be required to read it. He became deeply perturbed by his own behavior. At least, we will refer to it as his own.

Questions began to surface, things that entered his awareness in fleeting ways and suddenly plagued his consciousness. Truly the oddest sort of abstractions, ideas that had once seemed nonsensical. You know the sort, things you see people do that you scoff at and dismiss without a second thought because they seem outlandish. For example, it is often used as an insult toward those inclined to believe in theoretical conspiracies to say they are wearing tin-foil hats. You laugh. You never consider why they might wear one.

This is what led him to question magic.

Certain patterns had become apparent to him, one being that particular subjects are, at best, dismissed and, at worst, demonized, pun intended. To Devin, this could only be ignored up to a point. Why would something be deemed nonexistent by some, attacked by others, and casually mocked by grifters all at the same time? And further, why all the literature? There had probably not been enough time spent learning about magic before he decided he would much rather experience it.

The texts were exhausting, and he had barely begun. Without deliberation, he decided there was no better way than to simply do what seemed, or felt, like magic. He held no expectations of what might occur, likely due to doubt. He grabbed a sterling silver necklace, a gift from his late maternal grandmother, which hung wrapped around the handle of his bedroom door, and an ornate bowl that had belonged to his paternal grandmother and was passed down after her death. Quite superstitious behavior for someone who did not believe in magic.

After clearing everything from the dining room table, he placed the necklace, clasped and doubled over, into the center, with the bowl set inside the circle formed by the silver. Almost immediately, he realized he would need an offering. He only kept things he coveted, heirlooms and necessities. Something highly energetic would be required, surely.

He returned to the coffee table and retrieved his wallet, where he kept the only thing of value he was comfortable sacrificing. He opened it and found, alas, a ten-dollar bill and a one-dollar bill. Suddenly, Devin was no longer alone. George and Alexander had answered the summons, and just like that, it became a ritual.

After confirming he would not go hungry in the foreseeable future, he grabbed his matches from the cabinet and began to burn the bills, tossing them into the bowl one after another. These instruments were never something he expected to feel glee over while watching them incinerate. Yet Devin could not help but laugh as he wondered whether Alex or George had any matches left in their own cabinets. A pun of presidential proportions.

He sat there, watching as the bills turned to ash, leaving behind nothing but four tiny corners. An understanding washed over him. He had no idea why he had done this, nor what he should expect. And although he knew he was completely alone, he found himself compelled to look around, the way one does after doing something foolish and hoping no one saw.

Turns out, it was him.

He saw.

All of it, and never once did he consider how foolish it was, or that foolishness should have been the expected feeling afterward.

He left the dining room table as it was and returned to the living room, settling back at his computer. One of the radio’s antennas had come loose and fallen out of place, introducing a bit of static. He adjusted it before sitting back down. The song “Uproar” by Dwayne “Lil Wayne” Carter filled the room. He glanced back at the screen and resumed reading as though nothing had happened, trying to shake the feeling of stillness while simultaneously questioning why he was judging himself at all.

He became lost in thought, almost a trance. When people imagine a trance, they expect an empty mind. This was something else entirely, hyperactivity. Every word that entered his mind seemed to buzz. He had no awareness of it at the time, but this marked the beginning of Devin’s comprehension that he had his own witness.

Anyone familiar with the song “Uproar” knows that at the end of the track, a separate DJ-like voice closes it out with the words, “Let your shoulders work!” A high-pitched bell rings throughout the song. After some unknowable amount of time, what felt like half an hour but may have been mere moments, Devin realized that the voice on the radio had been speaking for some time. The realization jolted him out of his hyperfocus.

Imagine getting lost in your phone while someone is speaking to you. You know they are talking to you, yet you only catch a single word. Suddenly, you realize they are waiting for an answer to a question you cannot answer. You cannot respond confidently without admitting, to yourself and to them, that you were awake and asleep at the same time, and that they were speaking to the one who was asleep.

HHe glanced over at the radio as if he were about to ask it, “Wait, what?” The reaction was immediate. A familiar presence, or something close enough to be mistaken for one, filled the room. Or perhaps his awareness alone had expanded, and the two were no longer distinguishable. The voice from the radio no longer felt anchored to the device itself. Instead, it seemed to move inward, echoing within his skull in a way that stripped away what had always felt like certainty and replaced it with questions that had no answers. He no longer felt like the one operating his own vessel. Whoever, or whatever, now stood at the helm had rendered the rudder useless.

The voice shifted into something unrecognizable, and its origin became evasive in a way that left Devin in a state that could only be described as astonishment. He began to tremble, though not from fear at first. The voice no longer spoke in words. Instead, it impressed meaning directly upon him, causing him to feel what it conveyed rather than hear it. There was a moment of recognition, something remembered rather than learned, that felt like “there you are” and “here I am” occurring at the same time. It was as though he had stumbled into someone he had never met but had always known, someone he had been waiting to encounter without realizing it. The joy of that realization was brief.

The presence shifted again, taking on a fluidity that carried into his emotional state. With no forward motion of his own, the tide assumed control. At times, it felt like his grandmother. At others, it carried the tone of voices he had never met, perhaps ancestors he had never known. Then it changed into something darker. Something that carried not just anger, but disappointment. The kind that suggested expectation rather than surprise.

Fear struck him suddenly, sharp and total, like lightning hitting the bow of a ship. It felt as though something vast had noticed him and fixed its attention upon him. Alongside the realization that he had just been “met” for the first time came a far more unsettling understanding. Just because he had only just been met did not mean he had ever been alone. The presence made this unmistakably clear, and it did so with intent.

Shame, guilt, and self-conviction overwhelmed him. Devin found himself unable to move. A paralysis settled over his body, one that made escape feel as though it would require leaving his own skin behind. The walls within him felt suddenly alive, pressing inward as he clawed at them. The pressure tightened, compressing his lungs until the air itself felt unreachable.

After some unknowable span of time, the walls began to recede. They did not disappear, but they lowered. His lungs drew in air again. He began to cry, overcome by the exposure and the regret that accompanied it. The presence shifted once more, returning as something closer to forgiveness. It conveyed understanding without comfort, instruction without cruelty.

“You did not know, but you do now. Forget at your own risk.”

At last, Devin was able to draw a full breath, perhaps for the first time in his life. A profound relief followed, lifting the weight from his body and restoring sensation to his limbs. Whatever he had experienced began to fade, and its departure left behind a new understanding of what it meant to feel alone. The word itself seemed deeper now, altered by contrast. He felt control return to him, not as certainty, but as possession.

He stood and crossed the room to the radio, lowering himself to the floor beside it. As he adjusted the antennas, “Uproar” finally trailed off, giving way to the voice of the radio host addressing the audience. The room returned to itself. The walls remained. The air was quiet.

And Devin was alone again.

kbm.
