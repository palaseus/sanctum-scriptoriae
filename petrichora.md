The air grows taut before the rain,
A scent lifts lightly from the ground,
It drifts like brightness without name,
And leaves a silence all around.

The earth exhales a quiet call,
A promise carried on frail air,
It touches places that recall
What is not present anywhere.

No storm arrives to break the spell,
The fragrance hovers, soft and brief,
It hints at something none can tell,
A coming light, a gentle grief.

The dust remembers what might be,
This breath before the clouds unfold,
It lingers, neither bound nor free,
An absence bright, and never old.
