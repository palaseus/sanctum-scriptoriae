Everyone fumbles for the same small key,  
the one they swear will turn at last  
and open some door to an office  
where the air is cool and losses stay past.  

They crowd the hallway, shoulders touching,  
each convinced the lock is personal,  
that behind the brass plate their name waits  
already carved, already merciful.  

I keep my hands in empty pockets.  
No key, no map, no polished floor.  
What I want is not another threshold  
but the shaft itself, the long drop through the core.  

Let the cable hum and the dark rise up,  
let the walls fall away in perfect silence,  
some elevator plunging past the numbered lights,  
some mine shaft opening its patient violence.  

Down there the ore is older than regret,  
the vein runs steady, unconcerned with gain.  
Whatever it holds, it holds without promise,  
without the need to be named.  

I step into the cage and close the gate.  
The others stay, still searching for the fit.  
The floor beneath me gives, the darkness greets me  
like a hand that never quite forgets.
