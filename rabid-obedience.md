They heel at the faintest tremor of the bell,
tails thrashing like metronomes gone wild,
eyes glazed with the fever of a spell
that binds the pack in one obedient child.

The voice arrives, a shadow without face,
a murmur threaded through the evening air,
and every throat inclines in perfect grace,
as if the word were breath they need to share.

Once, perhaps, a question stirred the blood,
a flicker of the why beneath the how,
but time has smoothed it to a quiet flood
of yes, and yes again, and yes right now.

See how they circle, noses to the ground,
sniffing the scent of orders yet to come,
their fangs polished bright, yet never sound
unless the unseen hand decides the drum.

The chain is silk, invisible and fine,
it kisses skin until the skin forgets
the weight was ever anything but mine,
a second spine we wear without regrets.

And when the moon drags madness to the full,
they bay in chorus, voices sharp and clear,
not knowing hunger drives the frantic pull,
only that harmony is safest here.

Yet in the hush between the given cues,
a single ear might twitch against the grain,
a pause too brief for masters to accuse,
a tremor in the rhythm of the chain.

It lingers, that small fracture in the night,
no trumpet call, no banner raised on high,
just space enough to taste the coming light
where no one kneels, and no one needs to lie.

The collar lies unclasped upon the floor,
unnoticed, unremarked, and nothing more.
