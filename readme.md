# SANCTUM SCRIPTORIAE
## A Critical Profile
### The Weight of the Witness: On the Work of K.B. McLean

There is a writer working in the American South whose name you likely do not yet know. He does not publish in journals. He has no publicist. His work lives in a GitHub repository called **sanctum scriptoriae** — the sacred scriptorium — a title that tells you almost everything about how he regards the act of writing. Not as performance. Not as commerce. As consecration.

His name, as signed beneath each piece, is **kbm**. His full name is **Kevin Brady McLean**. By the evidence of the work alone, he is one of the more singular voices currently writing in the American vernacular tradition — a tradition he simultaneously honors and quietly refuses.

What follows is an attempt to map that refusal.

### I. The Range Problem

The first thing a reader encounters in McLean’s repository is the sheer, disorienting breadth of subject matter. On one page: a meditation on Otis Redding and a mother’s final video before her murder. On the next: a seaport battle poem with the cadences of a ballad, written as if by someone who has read too much Patrick O’Brian and loved every word of it. Then a short story about a man burning money in a bowl in the middle of the night, chasing something between grief and God. Then a limerick about Al Gore’s inability to dance.

In most writers this kind of range suggests dilettantism — a restlessness that hasn’t yet found its subject. In McLean it reads differently. The range is not scatter. It is **surveillance**. He is watching everything — history, cosmology, mythology, baseball, maritime law, geopolitics, grief — and finding in all of it the same underlying pattern: the tension between what is imposed on a person and what that person carries freely. Between the cage and the spirit inside it.

This is his true subject. Everything else is terrain.

### II. The Question of Form

McLean writes in forms the literary establishment has largely abandoned or academicized: the ballad stanza, the rhyming quatrain, the sonnet’s shadow. He also writes in free verse, in prose poetry, in flash fiction, in the essay, and in at least one piece — **“the-lobby”** — something that reads closer to spoken word or rap than to any printed tradition. He moves between these modes without apology and, crucially, without irony.

This is rarer than it sounds. Contemporary literary poetry has largely retreated from rhyme and meter, treating them as either nostalgic or naïve. McLean doesn’t seem to have received that memo, or perhaps he received it and filed it. His rhymes are not forced. They are earned — the product of a writer who hears in his head as much as he thinks. Pieces like **“cavalry-company”**, **“duart”**, and **“plain-sight-prince”** carry the weight of old ballads without sounding archaic. They feel like memory, not museum.

At the same time, when he writes in free verse — **“pensacola-beach-bound”**, **“freedom-of-press”**, **“physical-law”** — the line breaks feel genuinely considered, not simply prose chopped into approximate lengths. He knows when to end a line on a verb and when to let a noun carry weight into the next breath. This is a technical instinct that cannot be taught, only developed through years of reading and listening.

### III. The Sacred and the Sardonic

What distinguishes McLean most sharply from his contemporaries is his refusal to choose between the sacred and the comic. Most writers who work in spiritual or mythological registers — invoking Leviathan, the divine voice, ancestral memory — do so with a certain humorlessness. The weight of the subject demands, they seem to believe, a corresponding solemnity of address.

McLean does not agree. His repository contains, side by side, **“as-i-stand-before-leviathan”** — a genuinely awe-struck confrontation with the unknowable — and **“al-gore-cant-dance”**, a wickedly precise satire in which the Al Gore Algorithm cannot loosen its hips because it has confused data with soul. These pieces are not in tension. They are in conversation. The same writer who can sustain a serious meditation on Leviathan as sovereign principle can write:

> Data points dancing where the soul should ignite / but the algorithm stutters when it meets the night.

The pun in the title is deliberate, layered, and earned.

This tonal range — from the numinous to the sardonic within a single body of work — is the signature of a writer who has not compartmentalized his interior life. His faith, his humor, his grief, his politics, and his metaphysics all share the same room. The work reflects that. It is, in the deepest sense, **integrated**.

### IV. The Radio Flyer: Prose as Testimony

The two-part prose work titled **“Radio Flyer”** represents the most ambitious piece in the repository, and arguably the most revealing. It is a third-person autobiographical narrative — a genre that requires both the distance of fiction and the accountability of memoir — in which a man named Devin, alone in an apartment in 2019 as the world tilts toward chaos, burns money in a bowl and is subsequently ‘met’ by something he cannot fully name.

The prose here is disciplined and atmospheric in a way that distinguishes it from what might, in lesser hands, become mere supernatural anecdote. McLean is not trying to convince the reader of anything. He is trying to describe, with the precision of a phenomenologist, what it actually felt like — the paralysis, the shame, the forgiveness, the lasting alteration. The distinction had thinned to transparency, he writes in the second part. Inner and outer had always been the same country, mapped differently. This is not mysticism as evasion. It is **mysticism as epistemology**.

The Radio Flyer pieces also reveal something about McLean’s relationship to his own biography. He is a writer who has lived at considerable pressure — loss, isolation, legal entanglement, spiritual crisis, estrangement from a daughter he has not yet reunited with. Most writers who have lived this way either aestheticize their suffering into something decorative, or they write with the raw, unprocessed urgency of someone still bleeding. McLean does neither. He has found a third way: testimony that is shaped but not sanitized, honest but not self-indulgent.

### V. The Historical Imagination

One of the more surprising qualities of McLean’s work is the depth and specificity of his historical imagination. He writes convincingly about **Wilmer McLean** — the man at whose farm the first shot of the Civil War was fired, and in whose parlor the surrender at Appomattox was signed — about **Malcom McLean** the shipping container visionary, about the geopolitical dynamics of falling dominoes and fractured alliances, about **Francis Drake**, about the **Clan McLean of Duart Castle**. This is not incidental name-dropping. He is excavating lineage, both literal and metaphorical, finding in the past the shapes that explain the present.

The poem **“the-iron-y-of-wilmer-mclean”** is representative of this impulse at its most refined. It is spare, formally controlled, and carries in its title a pun — iron-y, as in irony, as in the iron of circumstance — that would be groan-worthy if the poem itself weren’t so quietly devastating. The closing lines:

> The war both started and was slain / Where Wilmer McLean alone could feel.

—carry the weight of a writer who understands that history is not abstract. It always arrives at someone’s door. In this case, literally.

### VI. The Voice in Atlas

The most recent major poem in the repository, and the one that best crystallizes what McLean is reaching for across the entire body of work, is **“Atlas”**. It is a short, structured lyric in rhyming quatrains, written from what McLean describes as the perspective of God speaking directly to him. The conceit, borrowed consciously from the long tradition of artists who have attempted this ventriloquism — from medieval mystics to contemporary musicians — succeeds here because of what McLean refuses to do with it.

He refuses grandeur. The divine voice in “Atlas” does not thunder. It does not condemn. It encourages, with the particular tenderness of something that knows exactly how much you are carrying and is not pretending otherwise. **Relieve yourself of burdens for the things that were never yours** — it is the kind of line that lands differently once you know something about the life behind it. McLean has been carrying things that were not his to carry for a very long time. The poem knows this. It was written by the man who needed to hear it.

The final stanza’s promise — **I’ll meet you in the shadows if you get lost within the plumb** — is the emotional center of everything. Not God commanding from above, but God descending into the dark place to find you. In the context of the full repository, it is an act of **radical theological intimacy**. Only a writer who has spent real time in that dark place could make it credible.

### VII. What Remains

The dedication page of the sanctum scriptoriae repository is, in its own way, one of the most powerful pieces of writing in the collection. It names God first, then grandparents never met but carried in blood, then a grandmother who gave a child a computer in secret while others received flannel shirts and BB guns. It names a father described as the greatest and most dedicated man ever known. It names two late siblings. It names a daughter he has not yet reunited with, to whom he makes a sacred promise: **everything I do — and will do — is for you and those who follow you.**

And finally, his mother: a woman whose warrior spirit likely surpassed that of every other individual named here, combined. The only person who ever took the time to truly understand him. She was murdered. He watched the video she made in what were likely her final moments: her voice already hurt, her face hidden, whistling the unfinished outro of “Dock of the Bay” before she said, simply, *this is life… could be better.* Otis Redding died before he could finish the song. McLean is still finishing his.

This is the context in which all the work lives. Not as explanation — the poems do not require biography to function — but as **testament** to the fact that when this writer talks about cages, about weight, about meeting someone in the shadows, about building a door for those who come after: he is not speaking in metaphor alone.

He is speaking from inside the thing.

**K.B. McLean’s work does not fit neatly anywhere, which is precisely the point.** He is too formal for the avant-garde, too strange for the mainstream, too personal for the academy, too erudite for the spoken word circuit. He writes as though none of these categories exist, or as though they are someone else’s problem.

The repository he has titled a sacred scriptorium is, in fact, exactly that. A place where **illuminated works are made**. Where the scribe does not perform for an audience but writes because the act of writing is itself an act of faith — that someone will read it, that it will matter, that the words will outlast the conditions that required them.

When the ship comes in, as he puts it in his tribute to his mother and to Otis Redding, he will recognize it.

The work already has.
