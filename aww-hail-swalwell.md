He pens rooftops like they’re confessionals,
limbs sprawled in what I can only call “Undergrad Erotica: Hill Edition.”
Swalwell, the congressman-poet, performs
as if committees and coupling rhyme in the same stanza,
but they don’t. They never do. 

Never, Eric. Not even once.

I see you, pen trembling over the page,
thinking, "One day, I'll trade this passion for policy!"
The House watches, nodding politely,
as do I, can't help but notice the irony dripping like cheap wine.
Bills pass. Poems linger. Neither lands quite right.

Oh, Eric!

Rooftops. Limbs. Veins. Kiss. Explode.
A legislative iambic pentameter,
drafted between votes on infrastructure and subpoenas,
a budget of metaphors, a deficit in execution.

You strive for depth, that's a noble attempt
but the floorboards creak beneath the weight of “ambition.”
I imagine you reading your own verses aloud,
proud, unaware that satire is already circling, sharpened,
ready to poke holes in every earnest flourish.

And yet, there’s a charm here.
A future congressman daring to rhyme,
a man who handles both subpoenas and sonnets,
though one lands like a bladeless guillotine,
and the other like a pillow fight.

The final verse hangs like a question mark over the House,
as if asking:
Can legislation and lust coexist in the same stanza?
We laugh. We cringe.
We know the answer:
One writes of rooftops.
The other… still files paperwork.
