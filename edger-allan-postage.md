Poe's haunted lines, like letters in the post,
Demand a stamp to journey through the years,
His ravens bear the weight of what is missed most,
Delivering the chill of buried fears.

Pear postage for the macabre, crisp and clear,
Affixed to envelopes of a Toga hue,
Where every tale arrives without a tear,
Enduring as the ink that binds them true.
