Until you first choose to be heart-led  
the blind will be led by the blind.  
Stead by the poets, whom art-fed,  
see Truth in the framework behind  

the brittle scaffolding of fact,  
where numbers and decrees grow cold.  
They trace the hidden, living tract  
that pulses beneath crowns of gold.  

For reason alone builds towers tall,  
yet windowless and sealed from light;  
the heart, though wild, can breach the wall  
and flood the dark with second sight.  

So turn from maps of silicon and ink,  
from grids that chart the world in lines  
where every star is pinned in sync 
and wonder ever, lowly dies.  

Let feeling be your compass rose,  
its needle trembling toward the vast;  
the poets walk where logic fears  
and find the future amongst the past.  

For only love can read the script  
etched faint upon the unseen air
the heart leads best when it's fires are lit,  
and truth is breathed, not reasoned there.
