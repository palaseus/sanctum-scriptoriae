I came with names etched deep in bone,  
Carved from scrolls and shadowed stone,  
Believing knowledge held the throne  
Where will and world might yet entwine.  
The sea before me lay in wait,  
A mirror flat, without a gate,  
And I, presuming to translate  
Its depths to measures of my line.  

From distant shores I bore the weight  
Of covenants, of oaths innate,  
The moral arc I deemed my fate,  
A clarity that pierced the brine.  
Yet as I stood, the waters stirred,  
Not by my call, nor spoken word,  
But by a presence long deferred,  
Rising slow from the unconfined.  

Leviathan, whose form defies  
The fragile frames of mortal eyes,  
Uncoils from abyssal lies  
Where pressure forges bone from night.  
No beast of myth, no scripted foe,  
But principle that ebbs and flows,  
The limit woven into woe,  
The sovereign depth that claims its right.  

Its scales, like continents adrift,  
Bear currents ancient, cold, and swift,  
Where time dissolves in salt's harsh gift,  
And darkness presses without light.  
I spoke the names, the sacred lore,  
From Job's lament to ocean's core,  
Expecting echo, nothing more,  
A dialogue to bend the tide.  

But silence met my uttered claim,  
No thunder roared, no judgment came,  
Only the swell that bore no name,  
Rearranging waves in quiet pride.  
The air grew thick with unseen force,  
My breath compressed, my pulse divorced  
From rhythms I had held by course,  
As if the deep had claimed my side.  

What sovereignty could I profess  
Against this vast, unyielding press?  
My will, a fleeting, fragile guess  
Amid the continuity of sea.  
For Leviathan regards no plea,  
No bargain struck on bended knee,  
But holds the covenant of decree,  
Where creation's bounds are drawn decree.  

In stillness then, it turned its gaze,  
Not eyes of fire, but endless haze,  
A movement vast that parts the ways  
Of knowing from the named decree.  
The waters parted, revealing bone  
Of whales long sunk, of empires gone,  
A rearrangement, stark and lone,  
Of history's fragments, set for me.  

Fear rose, not sharp, but slow and wide,  
A humility that could not hide  
Behind the veils of human pride,  
Nor control what depths decree.  
For what is will against the flow  
That carves the canyons far below,  
Where pressure shapes what none can know,  
And limits bind eternity?  

Questions lingered in the spray,  
Unanswered in the light of day:  
Can naming tame what will not stay,  
Or knowing grasp what shifts decree?  
Leviathan, in sovereign grace,  
Withheld its voice, its hidden face,  
Communicating through the space  
Where silence weighs more heavily.  

And as I stood, stripped bare of guise,  
My knowledge dimmed before those eyes,  
Identity dissolved in sighs  
Of breath that matched the ocean's heave.  
No triumph claimed, no ruin wrought,  
But reckoning in what was taught:  
The scale of self, so dearly bought,  
Now clarified in what I leave.  

Smaller now, yet etched with trace  
Of depths that grant no second place,  
I turn from that eternal space,  
Bearing knowledge words cannot weave.  
The sea resumes its soundless reign,  
Leviathan descends again,  
And I, in quiet, bear the strain  
Of truths that only silence cleave.
