I tread where kings have fallen silent, dust

Entombing thrones in veils of endless rust.

My lantern flickers, casting jagged gleams

On walls that whisper of forgotten dreams.

The path descends, a serpent carved in stone,

Through caverns vast where ancient winds have blown.

I feel the weight of centuries press near,

A thief in shadows, driven by my fear.

Yet cunning stirs, a fox within the night,

I leap the pits where echoes swallow light.

A rope I grasp, its coarse weave bites my palm,

Swinging o'er voids that claim the weak and calm.

The puzzles loom like riddles etched in fate,

Levers and locks that guard the royal gate.

Hieroglyphs awaken in the flame,

Tales of betrayal, glory turned to shame.

One misplaced step, and arrows slice the air,

A breath too loud, and boulders crash despair.

I dodge the beasts, their eyes like embers red,

Guardians born from myths the living dread.

Their claws rake stone, a thunder in the deep,

But wit prevails where brute force cannot keep.

The air grows thick with scents of mold and gold,

Hints of the prize kings long controlled

I pause, my heart a drum in hollow chest,

Reflecting on the fools who sought this quest.

For greed devours, a shadow at my side,

Whispering lies of wealth that cannot hide

The toll it takes, the lives it leaves behind,

A cycle spun in labyrinths of mind.

Deeper I delve, where waters drip like tears

From ceilings cracked by unrelenting years.

A bridge of wood creaks under cautious tread,

One snap away from plunging to the dead.

The wind now howls through fissures in the wall,

Carrying echoes of the siren's call.

I solve the maze, aligning stars in stone,

Revealing paths that lead to realms unknown.

And there it waits, the treasure's golden heart,

Glinting in torchlight, tearing me apart.

My fingers brush its surface, cold and bright,

A mirror showing truths I shun from sight.

For in its glow, I see my own decay,

The hunter hunted, lost along the way.

Obsession's chain, unbreakable and fine,

Binds me to ruins where no stars align.

Yet even now, as silence claims the hall,

Another doorway yawns, unspeaking and raw.

The cycle turns, a wheel of stone and bone,

Adventures endless, treasures never owned.

I turn away, or do I grasp once more?

The shadows lengthen, hiding what's in store.
