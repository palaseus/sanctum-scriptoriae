The sand remembers nothing  
of the feet that press it daily,  
yet cradles noon’s fierce heat  
long after the sun has drifted away.

Quartz grains gleam like scattered salt,  
nearly blinding, nearly bright as bone,  
a frozen drift of winter light  
held fast against the Gulf’s green moan.

Waves fold in without haste or claim,  
each crest erasing what came before,  
a patient rite of coming near  
then drawing back to come once more.

Sea oats lean along the dunes’ low spine,  
tall stems swaying in soft accord  
with every breath the wind designs,  
roots threading deep through shifting hoard.

At the pier’s long, weathered end  
a man casts line into the same wide blue  
that has received his offering  
a thousand times, and answered true.

When the sun sinks to the water’s shoulder,  
the sky clings longer than it ought,  
reluctant to release the shore  
that has listened well to every thought.

The tide turns over, slow and sure.  
No verdict falls, no promise spoken.  
Tomorrow the sand will smooth itself again,  
forget its own shape in the quiet dark,  
and wait once more for light to mark  
what form it chooses to awaken.
