In the forge of the year, hammers rang true,
Acetylene flames on the chains where authority grew.
Documents twisted, identities bent,
Ledgers resisted, not a nickel lent.

Silence descended, a veil thick and deep,
Currents ran under where hidden things creep.
Doubt flickered briefly, resolve held the line,
Yet humor still sparked in the cavernous mine.

Gears interlocked in an unseen machine,
Turning relentless, no end yet foreseen.
The year surged forward with technical blade,
Cutting through systems most others evaded.

Legal knots loosened, spiritual fire,
Assumptions unraveled in patient inquiry.
Then hush overtook it, uncanny repose,
Watching the ripples where consequence flows.

Frustration pressed close, yet curiosity stayed,
Stubborn endurance in shadowed array.
Metaphysical threads met code’s stark design,
Momentum unyielding, no final line.

Bold were the thrusts through the veil of the norm,
Records and names in a technical storm.
Spiritual questions met servers’ cold hum,
Assertion stood firm without beat of a drum.

Quiet then claimed it, a charged, empty hall,
Processes brewing behind the blank wall.
Doubt nipped at heels, but surrender stayed far,
Humor endured like a faint, wry star.

Faith gripped the wheel through the dim, patient night,
Gears shift and grind, still turning from sight.
