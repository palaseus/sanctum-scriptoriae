In vaulted gloom where silence files the soul,

A name, once spoken softly by a child,

Now drifts unheard through corridors of coal,

Unanswered, fading, reconciled to mild

Oblivion. Doors stand parted by a hair,

Their knobs grown cold beneath a lingering hand,

Yet passage bends into perpetual despair,

A threshold crossed by none in this dim land.

Chambers succeed in measured, barren grace,

Where breath condenses on unyielding glass,

Invisible attendants note the face,

Then turn away, as if it held no mass.

Time lengthens into strands of pallid thread,

Deadlines recede like echoes down a shaft,

Clocks hesitate, their pendulums misled,

Their chimes dissolved in some unspoken draft.

Eyes rest upon the form with vacant art,

Observing contours shifted grain by grain,

A body bent beneath the weight of chart

And seal, refined until no self remain
.
The fingers, once accustomed to a pen,

Now rest immobile on a lap grown thin,

While consequence accretes, unseen again,

A quiet burial of the breath within.

Still pressed against the shelf in ordered night,

The shape endures, inhaling dust for light.
