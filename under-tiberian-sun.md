I wake to the green haze that seeps through the vents,
The air thick with spores that settle like frost on my skin.
Once, fields stretched golden under a cleaner sun,
But now the ground shifts, veins pulsing beneath the thin
Crust of what we call soil. It grows without cease,
This crystal plague that devours and rebuilds in its wake,
Turning rivers to sludge, forests to jagged teeth.
I trace the maps in my mind, but they fade, remake
Themselves hourly, as if the earth conspires to forget.

Orders come crackling over the wire, terse and blind,
No reasons given, just coordinates etched in code.
March here, hold there, harvest what the fields provide,
Though harvest means scraping the glow from the node
Of infestation. We suit up in layers of steel and seal,
Breathing recycled ghosts of yesterday's breath,
While the suits hum warnings of breach, of yield
To the creeping rot. Technology binds us to death
Deferred, pumps life through veins laced with wire.

We are half machine now, augmented against the spread,
Limbs braced with alloy, eyes filtered through glass.
It keeps the heart beating, the blood from turning red
With alien fire, yet each upgrade exacts its tax:
A numbness that creeps from the ports in my spine,
Erasing the ache of old wounds, the warmth of touch.
Humanity frays at the edges, thread by thread,
As circuits whisper commands we obey too much,
Shaping us into tools for a war without face.

No fanfare marked its start, no treaty its close,
Just the slow grind of patrols through the blighted zones.
Years blur into cycles of alert and repose,
Where victory means another day without bones
Exposed to the air that eats them clean.
We fight not for glory, but quotas of ore,
The green wealth that fuels the endless machine.
Loss accumulates quietly, like dust on the floor:
A comrade's empty bunk, a village gone still.

I remember a time when rain fell clear and sweet,
Washing the world without leaving scars behind.
Now it carries the taint, etching patterns on sheet
Metal roofs, transforming what it finds
Into something other, neither living nor dead.
The land molds us too, in its indifferent grasp,
Hardening resolve into callus, dread
Into routine. We adapt or dissolve in the clasp
Of inevitability, green threads in our blood.

Yet in quiet hours, when the scanners sleep low,
I feel the pull of what lingers, faint as a dream:
A child's laugh echoing from a life ago,
Before the skies sickened, before the seam
Of horizon split wide with crystalline spires.
The war has no arc, no climax to claim,
Just persistence, a rhythm that never tires.
We endure as procedure, pawns in the game
Of erosion, where even memory yields.

And when my watch ends, perhaps in some forgotten trench,
The spores will claim what's left, weaving me in.
But the convoys will roll, the harvesters wrench
More from the veins, and the cycle begins
Anew, under the same poisoned light.
