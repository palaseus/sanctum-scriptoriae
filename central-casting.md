Finally moved on, but I've kept all of the memories
Dispelled all the ghosts, the vampires to my energy
No longer morose, but sometimes I still pretend to be
I think that I'm okay, even if you aren't here to see

So many things I've learned since I lost the closest friend to me
Not everything that glitters is always what it appears to be 
Anger's nothing to hold, it's victory for your enemies

I've never been one for empathy, in fact it's the opposite for me, generally, but you taught me not to let it all weigh so heavy on me mentally. That the whole world is chemistry. 

You and I were phosphorous, chemically. Composition-B every moment, explosive, potentially. No remedy for the shockwaves felt in all of our extremities until it rained, then it poured, the sky fell exponentially.
