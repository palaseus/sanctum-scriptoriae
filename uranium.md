Two souls, lost, were found amongst the dark
Upon that dock, grasping out into the very painted reflection

A simple, yet subtle chosen blue-hued projection 
Equally delicate and candle-lit by Mother Moon, herself

The universe illuminated purple silver as if signed, sealed, circled and delivered by the hands of God, himself, unto the very heavens

We trembled a shake never shivered sharing that summer - lips quivered in that night, Octavian heated, as all the stars exploded and the uranium depleted
