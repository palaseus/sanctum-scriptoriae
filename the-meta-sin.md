We choose the haze where clarity once burned,
a deliberate dimming of the inner light,
and turn from mirrors that would have returned
the unflinching gaze we forfeit to the night.

Not lust that pulls, nor blindness born of chance,
but calculated drift from what we are-
we abdicate the throne of self at a glance,
and crown distraction sovereign where truths once stood ajar.

The mind, alert, elects its own eclipse,
aware yet willing, seals the deeper door;
it walks the surface, tasting shallow sips,
while depths lie waiting, patient, on the floor.

This is the sin no scripture needs to name:
to know the self and still refuse the claim,
to wake each morning and forget the flame.
