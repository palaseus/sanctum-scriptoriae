I'm peering through the glass
Everything is still
Last night's precipitation
Covers my window sill

Today I'll take a trip down to
Arcadia Mill
But this time, not with you
Just to remember what was real

Surrounded by the fall leaves
I skip across the planks
Focus on my own rhythm-
Trying not to think

I can feel the pine breathe
While the river tells it's stories 
Flowing on like time's fluid,
With mother nature's glory

I tire amongst the trees and rest across the bench
Wonder how she perseveres and doesn't even flinch

There seems to be an answer
In the song of the birds
I'd truly love to sing back
But can't find the words
