Before him, oceans were slow and wide,
Time crawled where ships would bide.
Ports choked in toil, hands and cranes,
Commerce stalled in endless chains.

He dreamed in steel, in boxes aligned,
A world compressed, yet unconfined.
Each crate a pulse, each stack a vein,
A heartbeat moving through sea and plain.

No sword, no throne, no fame to chase,
Yet he rewrote the human race.
From harbor to harbor, nation to nation,
He built the veins of globalization.

Goods now flow as thoughts might race,
Distance shrinks, and space finds grace.
Every parcel, every distant reach,
Whispers of the man who taught the world to breach.

We click, we scroll, we shop, we trade,
All paths of life his vision made.
Unseen, yet felt in every gain,
So was the mind of Malcom McLean
