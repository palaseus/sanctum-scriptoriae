Beneath the pine and breaking dawn;
upon the yew, sinew string is drawn.
The mark is neither friend nor foe,
as one eye tracks the yearling doe.

Fearless the archer, but for the howl,
of the wolf or the bare stomach growl.
It is the latter that calls for sacrifice,
and what would prosper now pays the price.

With no wind fall, and the forest still;
soaring cedar carries the hunger's will.
No points to count, there's only a cost;
No trophy hangs for things that are lost.

A midsummer morning now has need for fire;
an unfortunate act becomes what is admired.
Smoke fills the air as what burns turns to coal,
what's fulfilled the flesh has emptied the soul.
