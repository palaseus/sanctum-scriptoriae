# Dedication

All projects within my GitHub profile are hereby dedicated to the following:

---

## **My God**

May You see that when You called my name, I came running.  
We will never part.  
Our time in the secret place sparked illumination.

---

## **My Grandparents**

**Ray McLean**  
**Lois Nowling McLean**  
**Donald Earl McCall**

Though we never met, I carry your blood and likeness with honor.

## **Lindell Kelley McCall**

My grandmother—who saw potential in me and gifted me my first computer in secret,  
while my cousins received flannel shirts and B.B. guns.

## **Teachers Who Saw Me**

**Lauren Shippie** — English *(MHS)*  

The recognition shown to me by these remarkable women helped shape my path in ways that must be acknowledged.  
*And so it is.*

## **My Mother**

**Laura Denise McLean**

A woman whose warrior spirit likely surpassed that of every other individual named here, combined.  
The only person who ever took the time to truly understand me.

My resilience, creativity, and capacity to love unconditionally are traits I will forever attribute to her alone.

Rest assured: as long as these horrors persist—and beyond—so will I.

## **My Daughter**

**Cora Danielle McLean**

Though you entered this world under great strife, and though we have yet to meet again,  
everything I do—and will do—is for you and those who follow you.

When I pass on my torch, its flame will burn eternal.  
*A sacred promise.*
