Originally, all I wanted was my energy back.
Now I want yours, the slow heat left against the door  
where your hand rested once, then fell away,  
the wood still faintly warm, though you are no more.  

I thought the body would forget its debt,  
the borrowed light it gave and never claimed,  
but every threshold holds the shape you set,  
a pressure faint, yet never quite the same.  

The rooms have learned to carry what you spent  
without return, the quiet after-breath  
that lingers in the grain of every vent,  
a current neither living nor of death.  

I do not knock. The silence keeps its place.  
The meter turns. The shadows lengthen slow.  
What you released becomes the thing I trace,  
not to restore, but simply to know.  

The door stands closed. The warmth has not yet fled.  
I wait for what was given, never said.
