There once was a voice from the state,
That left messages heavy with weight.
It demanded the call,
Ignored writing at all
A preference for speech over slate.

Requests for the page went unheard,
The spoken was stubbornly preferred.
Coercion in tone,
Through the wires alone,
A tactic both sharp and absurd.

Then seven letters stormed in one day,
Each sealed with official display.
Deadlines so tight,
In the holiday light,
Three days to comply or obey.

Early July, with its federal pause,
Sunday intruded without any cause.
Artificial rush,
In procedural hush,
Asymmetry woven in laws.

The pressure was crafted with care,
Paperwork piled in the air.
Urgency feigned,
Power unrestrained,
A game played with timing so rare.

Resistance arrived, calm and sure,
No panic, no hasty allure.
Defiance held ground,
Without trumpet sound,
Observing the moves to endure.

Then silence descended at last,
The barrage now firmly in past.
No follow-up came,
In the institutional game,
Just waiting, both measured and vast.

The voicemails grew cold in their slot,
The letters sat answered or not.
Consequences brew,
Out of sight, out of view,
In channels where motions are caught.

Deadlines expired in the heat,
Holiday quiet complete.
No closure arrived,
Yet something survived
A thread in the balance discreet.

The agent’s role faded from view,
No further demands ever flew.
Paper and voice,
In tactical poise,
Left ripples that steadily grew.

Timing’s precision still lingers near,
Pressure suspended in gear.
No resolution neat,
Just motion discreet,
Through silence both charged and severe.

The year watched the play without haste,
Noted each calculated waste.
Waiting extends,
Where the process bends,
Unfinished, in shadowy space.

There once was a bureau’s design,
That favored the fleeting phone line.
But ink was denied,
Till the letters collided
A flood meant to force the align.

Yet calm observation prevailed,
No frenzy, no outburst assailed.
The deadlines collapsed,
As the calendar lapsed,
And quiet in turn was unveiled.

So processes turn underground still,
Consequences wait for their fill.
No end to the arc,
In the lingering dark
Just motion, against the state’s will.
