He steps to the floor in a suit pressed precise,  
tie knotted like code, shoes polished for ice.  
The beat kicks hard, bass thumps in the chest,  
but Al holds the graph, won’t loosen the vest.  

Al-gore-rhythm humming, cold loop in his veins,  
predictive, prescriptive, pre-planned in chains.  
Every move mapped out on a sliding scale,  
carbon footprint tracked, no room to derail.  

He counts the degrees while the drummer ignites,  
tells the crowd “feel the crisis,” but kills all the lights.  
His shoulders stay square, elbows locked at ninety,  
moral imperative, no bend in the psyche.  

He warns of the flood, points to rising seas,  
yet stands in the pocket like he’s nailed to the freeze.  
The DJ scratches fire, the cipher revolves,  
Al quotes the models, but the groove dissolves.  

Multisyllabic mandate, optimized decree,  
he speaks in projections, no room for the free.  
Data points dancing where the soul should ignite,  
but the algorithm stutters when it meets the night.  

I slip through the margins, untracked and untamed,  
off-grid in the pocket where the real ones remain.  
He calculates sway, tries to quantify glide,  
but the body keeps secrets no server can hide.  

He forecasts the tempo, the rise and the fall,  
yet the kick drum defies every line on his wall.  
The system can measure, can label, confine,  
but it locks at the hips when it’s time to recline.  

So let him keep preaching, keep plotting the curve,  
I’ll move through the cracks that his models preserve.  
The floor stays alive when the numbers stand still—  
Al Gore can’t dance, and he never will.
