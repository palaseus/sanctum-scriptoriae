Count the steps.
Left, left, right then left
That’s how a falsehood learns to march.

Pressed and creased, he learned the walk,
Learned the grin, the sanctioned talk.
Salutes sharp, the posture clean,
A practiced mask for what lay between.

He stacked his days in ordered rows,
Rank above and rot below.
Kept twin ledgers, fed them both-
One for law, one for the oath.

No storm, no fire, no foreign hand,
His chaos unfit for command
Just quiet hours, deliberate choice,
A private sin without a voice.

Belief his silence made him safe,
Thought clearance cleansed the stain of face.
But secrets grow their own demands,
And rot outpaces human plans.

So strike the roll.
Correct the line.
Let truth assume what rank resigned.

Lieutenant Commander
Gregory Edward McLean-
Him, measured, found, and left behind.
