What are the things that we can say while we're still being honest
I can't remember everything but I know that I made you a promise
Some stories are written in the stars, others only in the comets
The truth exists so save yourself some room to be astonished

I know that flesh feels heavy but your spirit can't be caged
Not the wisdom of the wizard nor the force within the mage
It is within your nature, that of the seer and the sage
You'll find all the wonder in the turning of the page

Relieve yourself of burdens for the things that were never yours
But hold on to hope, for you will build yourself a door
To make way for those that follow and those who came before
Keep your faith in your compass, not the number of the score

I'll meet you in the shadows if you get lost within the plumb
Remind you where you are going and just how far you've come
Rejoice in war and peace, and welcome the sound of the battle drum
When the victory is yours, you will remember where you're from
