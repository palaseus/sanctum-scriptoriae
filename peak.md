I know you may find me odd
but so is every sign from God
Calling you to practice what you preach
For I come to you both in peace and in pieces
With humility, I come so humbly.

How about you and I, we move a couple mountains?
If you're made of a wind then I'm the fountain
Why go on and pretend that we're not kin
when it's the years that we've counting?
Are you still doubting me?
Hopelessly?

I've built a home in you that I'm still decorating
It's running out of room for hesitating
Cross-legged in your halls, I'm waiting
Perhaps just meditating
in your heart I am initiated
like it's making me
it's been taking me

How about you and I, we move a couple mountains?
If you're made of a wind then I'm the fountain
Why go on and pretend that we're not kin
when it's the years that we've counting?
Are you still doubting me?
Hopelessly?

Don't look away- we both have so much left to say
and surely there will come a day when we both speak
I'll pull my ribs apart, and set a lantern there inside
so you can take your peek, tell me what you see.

How can we be piqued, when we don't peak?
