He walked Chipper Lane one summer dusk,  
the air thick with pine and the low hum  
of cicadas rising from the ditch.  
She stood on the porch, hair catching the last gold,  
a girl named Jones, laughing at something small,  
her voice carrying across the quiet yard  
like a ball hit clean to the warning track.

He was fourteen, maybe fifteen, heart  
still learning the difference between want  
and wonder. She waved him over, casual,  
as though the whole world had not just tilted.  
They talked of nothing that mattered then,  
school, the heat, the river behind the houses,  
yet every word felt carved in the soft wood  
of first knowledge.

Later, alone in his room, he lay staring  
at the poster above his bed: Chipper Jones,  
third baseman, switch-hitter, the Braves' own,  
born not far from here, in DeLand, raised  
on the same sandy soil, the same long light.  
The name Jones again, the same easy swing  
in the photograph, the same quiet confidence.

He sat up suddenly, breath caught.  
Chipper Lane. Jones. The street named  
for no one famous, perhaps, yet here  
the pieces fit too neatly to be chance.  
His first love lived where the hero's shadow  
had once fallen, or so the boy believed  
in that bright, foolish instant when youth  
makes every coincidence a sign.

He never told her. Some truths are better  
kept inside, like a perfect game  
held close until the final out.  
Years would pass, the girl would fade  
into the ordinary ache of memory,  
the player would retire, the street remain.

Yet on certain evenings, when the dusk  
settles slow over the pines, he still walks  
that same lane in thought, feeling again  
the quiet shock of putting two and two  
together, the way a boy discovers  
that love, like baseball, arrives  
without announcement, stays longer  
than the season, and leaves  
its mark on every field he ever knew.
