In chambers dim where monarchs schemed,
A shadow lingers, veiled in grace,
His form a thread through history's seam,
Eternal watch on time's slow pace.

He tends the violet flame concealed,
That subtle fire of change unknown,
Transmuting eras' wounds unhealed
To quiet gold, where ash was sown.

No crown he claims, no scepter bright,
But custodianship through vein and bone,
A covenant whispered into night,
Passed hand to hand, from stone to stone.

Through Versailles' gleam and Bastille's roar,
He glides, a murmur in the fray,
Steering the tide from shore to shore,
Yet leaving no imprint on the clay.

In hidden vaults where secrets bind,
He forges continuity's chain,
Not seizing thrones, but minds refined,
Preserving light through storm and rain.

For he has walked the futures past,
And seen the cycles bend and break,
A steward sworn to hold them fast,
Till dawn renews what night would take.
