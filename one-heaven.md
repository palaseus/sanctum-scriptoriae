There's a select few it makes a difference to-
but rest-assured: it matters to thee.
The truth is, it takes a fool
to assume that any papal bull
holds more weight or scored fate than a divine decree.

There is a certain brutality to duality-
when in reality One Heaven is all that I see.
One hand makes the tools
the other makes the rules
Giving up the right but holding on tight to the ability to be free.
