The shell pile rises, white and still,
beside the Blackwater's tea-dark flow,
a quiet hill of ancient will
where once the hungry gathered slow.

Oyster upon oyster lay,
cracked open by forgotten hands,
then left to mark the passing day
in ridges on the river's sands.

No plaque records the lives that fed
upon these gifts the water gave,
only the pile, unbowed, unbled,
holds witness where the current glides.

Cypress knees lift from shadowed stream,
like sentinels of patient time,
their roots drink deep the river's dream,
their silence speaks in measured rhyme.

The water moves without a sound,
carries the years, returns no name,
yet here the shells endure, profound,
a testament to daily claim.

Fishermen launch their boats once more,
cast lines into the same dark vein,
the pile remains, unchanged before,
while time dissolves the rest in vain.

The river bends, the light grows thin,
the shells keep watch through dusk and dawn.
What hands began, the years have been
too slow to carry, too patient gone.
