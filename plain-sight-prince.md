In shadowed courts where whispers bind
The gilded throne to fate's design,
A figure walks the common line,
Unmarked by crown or jeweled rind.

He treads the dust of market squares,
Where merchants hawk their daily wares,
And beggars lift their hollow stares,
Yet none discern the blood he bears.

His voice, a murmur soft and plain,
Carries the weight of ancient strain,
A lineage lost in time's refrain,
Concealed within the mundane vein.

Through festivals and famine's grip,
He watches empires slowly slip,
His wisdom forged in quiet trip
Of years that carve but never strip.

No fanfare calls his hidden name,
No banners blaze his silent claim,
He rules in absence, free from fame,
A sovereign soul in borrowed frame.

And when the stars align to show
The truth that only shadows know,
He fades into the afterglow,
Leaving the world to wonder slow.
