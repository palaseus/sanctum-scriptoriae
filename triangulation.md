A shape of which should not be named in respect of its sacred power,
Bringing the Light to the righteous and the dark to those who cower.
Its point made cleanly, peering down from above!
Fills the latter with hate, the former with love.

On its base the arbiter's labyrinth is etched, as the Chapel, Sistine;
In each cardinal direction is a symmetrical edge every angle pristine
At a glance, from below, you'd figure it a square!
It's your position, however, that makes it unfair.

A shade of such brilliance resounds in its shadow, perfect and casted,
Who braves to toil within penumbra is learned then silently outlasted.
Some find a purpose, perhaps even prosper, but falls!
Its true form is known only to whom it solely calls.

Seldom moment comes a glimpse of gleam, the door itself exposes with time,
The labrynth a lock for which a key is held by those worthy of its design.
A truth is formed by beholder, shaped further by angle!
All that exists is contained by the walls of a triangle.
