The first shot found his quiet door,
A breakfast table torn by flame;
War announced itself once more
As if it learned to speak his name.

He fled the sound, he sought a place
Where guns were meant to never come,
Yet fate has little use for grace
When history demands a sum.

Four years weighed heavy on the land,
Till uniforms filled parlor air;
The end was signed by steady hand
Where peace had once been meant to bear.

No trumpet marked the closing page,
No banner crowned the war’s retreat;
It simply paused upon the stage
Of his home- his hearth, his loss, his seat.

So let the blood stand where it stain,
Not all the scars are earned by steel;
The war both started and was slain
Where Wilmer McLean alone could feel.
