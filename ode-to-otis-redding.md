Before my mother was murdered, in what was likely her final moments on earth, she made and uploaded a short video to her Facebook.

In it, she sounds as though she has been hurt. She does not show her face. She says only, “This is life… could be better.”

Just before speaking, she can be heard whistling the tune of one of her favorite songs:
“(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” by Otis Redding.

Most people know the song. Fewer know that the whistling at its end was never meant to be final. It was a placeholder... Otis Redding died before he could finish it. The song was released unfinished, after his death.

I will never know why she chose that song, when she could have said any number of things, or whistled any number of tunes. I will never be able to ask.

Imagine my dismay when, a year and a half later, I found myself immersed in the study of maritime law...entirely in the name of survivorship, stewardship, and heirship.

When my ship rolls in, I will recognize it.
And I will act.
There is not a second to waste.
