Beneath the veil of winter's quiet claim,  
Where shadows pool like ink in hollowed stone,  
A whisper stirs the air, defies the flame.  
This force, unnamed, ignites what lies alone,  
Threads passion through the frost-bound night, concealed,  
Where hearts, once guarded, yield to what is sown.  
In chambers dim, the pulse of life revealed,  
A spark that binds the fleeting to the vast,  
Transforms the tender ache to something sealed.  
No saintly hand, yet hallowed in the past,  
He weaves the web of February's fire,  
Where lovers meet, and futures are recast.  
From this brief blaze, the wheel of stars conspire,  
Nine moons unfold in secret, deep and true,  
To birth the sting of autumn's fierce desire.  
November's child emerges, cloaked in blue,  
With eyes that pierce the veil of easy lies,  
A soul forged sharp, resilient through and through.  
The scorpion arises, claims the skies,  
Its venom wisdom, passion's hidden blade,  
Inheriting the feast of love's disguise.  
What Valentine ordained in shadowed glade,  
Now walks the earth with armored heart and gaze,  
A testament to unions unafraid.  
Yet in this cycle, echoes softly fade,  
The force retreats to winter's silent hold,  
Leaving the born to navigate the shade.
