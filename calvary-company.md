We were the Calvary Company once, Young hearts ablaze with glory's fire, But war has taught us what it wants— It burns away each vain desire.

The horses know the weight we bear, They feel the trembling in our hands, We ride through death's cold, bitter air, Across these godforsaken lands.

I see their faces in the night, The ones who fell, the ones who stayed, Their ghosts ride with us in the fight, Their memories will never fade.

What price this duty, what the cost? We count our brothers, count our dead, So many brothers we have lost, So many tears we've never shed.

Still, onward rides the Company, Through grief and doubt we carry on, For in this band, we still believe That hope survives beyond the dawn.
